# Microleaf Lyghts
Full-fledged remake of Nanoleaf Lights.

Modular lights that are controlled with a single mobile app, inspired by modern trends. To achieve this, I had to learn how to work with electronics, synchronization, communication between devices and develop mobile app that is compatible with multiple operating systems.
